I already mentioned the drops, but some drops are illegal:

- dropping a pawn when one has already a pawn in the same column is illegal (it's fine if it's a promoted pawn instead though).

- dropping a piece on a square where it cannot move

- checkmating with a pawn drop. This can be a reason for not promoting a rook or bishop. See [this video of a professional game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI3bqBF69I4) for an example.

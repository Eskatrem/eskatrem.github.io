## Tournament

The tournament will consist of four rounds of crazyhouse. 

The time control will be 30 30. 

The results will be updated in this page.

The eight players will be divided in two blocks of four players, block A and block B. The players of each block will play a round robin tournament.

After that:

- the first player of block A will face the first player of block B

- the second player of block A will face the second player of block B

- the third player of block A will face the third player of block B

- the fourth player of block A will face the fourth player of block B

This will allow everybody to play four games.

The composition of the two blocks will be decided randomly by Slek.

### Matching and colours

Players are expected to discuss between themselves to find a convenient time to play their game, and then manually match each others. We will let the server decide of the colours.



### Rankings and tie breaks

The total score according to the football rule (win: 3 points, draw: 1 point, defeat: 0 points) will be used to rank the players.

When some players have an equal score, the following tie breaks will be used (in that order):

1. sum of the scores of the defeated opponents

2. head to head score

3. number of games where the player was Black

4. random decision (Slek will sort the players randomly if he is not involved in the tie break, otherwise another player will be designated).

### Use of the tie breaks

The tie breaks will be used twice:

- to decide of the rankings in each block so we can decide the pairing of the final round

- after the final round has been played so we can have the final rankings.

# Shogi for chess players

This essay is about teaching shogi. Instead, I want the reader (typically a chess player) to really feel what it's like to play shogi and see the differences with chess.

## About me: who am I to write this?

I have been played chess in club for a while, reaching a FIDE rating of 2000 before going down to 1900. I knew about Shogi since 2001 and started playing irregularly in 2008, however I really got serious about it around March 2019 after I moved to Japan.

## A brief description of Shogi

Shogi is the Japanese chess. Similar to chess, it has various pieces including a king, and to win, one has to checkmate the opponent's king. There are four big differences between shogi and chess:

- in shogi, the captured pieces can be reused: after a player ha captured a piece, during his turn, instead of playing a "normal" move, he can take the pice and drop it on the board, the piece being his.

- the pawns: in chess, they capture diagonally, and so they can protect each other, and pawns from opposite sides can blockade each other. In shogi, the pawn capture the same way they move (one square forward), so generally there are empty squares between pawns.

- the shogi pieces are generally weaker than their chess counterparts

- most of the shogi pieces can promote. On the other hand, the pawns can only promote into a Golden General (a piece that can move one square in 6 directions), unlike chess when a promoted pawn can become whatever the player chooses.

## Shogi's endgames and chess' endgames

In both shogi and chess, a game is won by mating the opponent's king. However in chess, players typically don't win by directly mating the opponent's king. Instead, they try to amplify small advantages to the point that they become so big that mating becomes trivial. This amplification process is mostly done by trading material. For example, being a pawn up when there are lots of pieces on the board is not much, but being a pawn up when there are only the kings on the board can be a huge advantage.

On the other hand, in shogi, trading pieces doesn't simplify the position as the pieces can be reused (actually, I would say that a pieces trade makes the position more complex as a captured piece can reappear anywhere on the board), and to win the game, one has to actually mate the opponent's king. Therefore the typical flow of a shogi game is the two sides trying to make progress towards the other side's king, and the winner being the one who is the fastest to mate.

Due the importance of mating in shogi, a special importance is given to it in training. In shogi, there is a type of problems, called *tsume*, that doesn't quite have an equivalent in chess: a *tsume* problem is a problem where one has to checkmate the opponent's king by giving consecutive checks, in order no to let the opponent get back the initiative (parrying a check with a check is theoretically possible in shogi, but in practise very rare given that most shogi pieces are short range pieces).
